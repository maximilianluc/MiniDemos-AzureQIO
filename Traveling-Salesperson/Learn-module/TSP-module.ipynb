    "In the [Quantum Computing Foundations](/learn/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals?azure-portal=true) learning path, you have helped the spaceship crew optimize its asteroid mining expeditions and reparations of critical onboard emergency systems. Now you have been asked to code the navigation system for the spaceship to optimize its travel routes through the solar system. The spaceship needs to visit numerous planets, moons, and asteroids to mine and sell the space rocks. In this module, you'll use the Azure Quantum service to minimize the travel distance of the spaceship. \n",

You can find applications of the traveling salesperson problem, or slight modifications of it, in a variety of fields. For example, in logistics, chemical industries, control theory, and bioinformatics.

    "\n",
    "For the module, we define the traveling salesperson problem for the spaceship as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "You have a set of $N$ locations (planets, moons, and asteroids) that need to be visited. As the newly appointed navigation engineer, you have to code the navigation system in order to find the shortest routes through the solar system. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of conditions that you will need to fullfill in order for the navigation system to be considered 'successful' by the crew. These will be considered the problem constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditions:\n",
    "  - `One location at a time constraint` - The spaceship can only be in one planet, moon, or asteroid at a time. No magic!\n",
    "  - `No dissapearing constraint` - The spaceship has to be in a location, it can not disappear!\n",
    "  - `No revisiting locations constraint` - The spaceship may **not** visit a location more than once, except the homebase (start/end location). \n",
    "  - `Start and end locations constraints` - The spaceship has to start and finish in the home base, which will be Mars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please consider the following points for the module as well:\n",
    "  - We will ignore orbital mechanics and use real approximate mean distances between the planets, moons, and asteroids. Distances are in millions of kilometers. All locations have a terrestrial surface (no gas planet included, as that is hard to mine).\n",
    "  - We will not specify where the space rocks can, and can not be, sold and mined. However, you may expand the constraints yourself to include such criteria.\n",
    "  - The $N$ locations are (in order) : Mars, Earth, Earth's Moon, Venus, Mercury, Ganymede (moon), Titan (moon), Ceres (asteroid), Pallas (asteroid), Cybele (asteroid). Naming the planets will make it easier to read the solutions returned by the solver!\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## About the problem\n",
    "The goal behind reprogramming the navigation system is to find a suitable interplanetary route to minimize the spaceship's travel distances. Having a (near)-optimal route will not only lower the total distance but will also reduce the ship's energy consumption and the number of working hours for the crew. An efficient route is crucial to the overall productivity of the spaceship's mining ambitions!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to create a **cost function**, which is used to model the travel costs **and** travel constraints of the spaceship. A particular route wants to be found that minimizes the cost function as much as possible. By incorporating the constraints into the cost function through penalties, the solver can be encouraged to settle for certain solution sets. Intuitively, you can imagine this as designing the rugged optimization landscape such that the 'good' solutions (routes) have lower cost values (minima) than 'bad' solutions. Even though the problem sounds easy to solve, for a large number of locations it becomes nearly impossible to find the optimal route (global minima). The difficulty is predominantly caused by:\n",
    "- the rugged optimization landscape (non-convex). \n",
    "- the combinatorial explosion of the solution space, meaning that you may not be able to check every possible route.\n",
    "- the variables optimized for are non-continuous, $x_{v} \\in \\{0,1\\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!TECHNICAL NOTES]\n",
    "> The traveling salesperson problem in which an optimal route needs to be found belongs to the set of [NP-hard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness?azure-portal=true). First, there is no explicit algorithm for which you can find the optimal solution, meaning that you are faced with a search of the $(N-1)!$ (factorial number of routes to pass through all the locations) possible routes. Secondly, to verify whether a candidate solution to the traveling salesperson problem is optimal, you would have to compare it to all $(N-1)!$ other candidate solutions. Such a procedure would force you to compute all routes which is an **extremely** difficult task for large $N$ (non-polynomial time $\\mathcal{O}((N-1)!)$).\n",
    "> The total number of routes for the traveling salesperson problem is dependent on the problem formulation. For generality, we will consider the directed version (`directed graph`) of the traveling salesperson problem, meaning that every route through the network is unique. Therefore you can assume that there are $(N-1)!$ different routes possible, since a starting location is given. \n",

    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With problem background dealt with, you can start looking at modeling it. In this unit, we will first go over how to calculate the spaceship's travel costs. This will become the foundation of the cost function. In later units, you will expand the cost function by incorporating penalty functions (constraints), to find more suitable routes throughout the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the travel cost matrix $C$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a single trip for the spaceship, from one planet to another. The first step is to give each location (planet, moon, asteroid) a unique integer in $\\{0,N-1\\}$ (N in total). Traveling from planet $i$ to planet $j$ will then have a travel distance\n",
    "of $c_{i,j}$, where $i$ denotes the `origin` and $j$ the `destination`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{The origin location } (\\text{node}_i) \\text{ with } i \\in \\{0,N-1\\}.$$\n",
    "$$ \\text{The destination location } (\\text{node}_j) \\text{ with } j \\in \\{0,N-1\\}.$$\n",
    "$$ \\text{Distance from } \\text{location}_i \\text{ to } \\text{location}_j \\text{ is } c_{i,j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing out the travel distances for every $i$-$j$ (origin-destination) combination gives the travel cost matrix $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel cost matrix:\n",
    "$$C = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \\dots & c_{0,N-1} \\\\ c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \\dots & c_{1,N-1} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1,0} & c_{N-1,1} & \\dots & c_{N-1,N-1} \\end{bmatrix}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the rows are indexed by $i$ and represent the origin locations. The columns are indexed by $j$ and represent the destination locations. For example, traveling from location $0$ to location $1$ is described by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C(0,1) = c_{0,1}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The travel cost matrix is your spaceflight \"dictionary\", the most important asset to you as the spaceship's navigation engineer. It contains the most crucial information in finding a suitable route through the solar system to sell and mine space rocks. The measure of the travel cost is arbitrary. In this module the cost we want to minimize is the distance, however you can also use time, space debris, space money, ..., or a combination of different costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the location vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "With a travel cost formulation between two locations complete, a representation of the origin and destination needs to be defined to select an element of the travel cost matrix. Remember, this is still for a single trip between location $i$ and location $j$. Selecting an element of the matrix can be achieved by multiplying the matrix with a vector from the left, and from the right! The left vector and right vector specify the origin and the destination, respectively. Consider the example where the spaceship travels from planet $0$ to planet $1$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Travel cost - location 0 to location 1 }=  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \\dots & c_{0,N-1} \\\\ c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \\dots & c_{1,N-1} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1,0} & c_{N-1,1} & \\dots & c_{N-1,N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = c_{0,1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the spaceship can only be in one location at a time, and that there is only one spaceship, therefore only one element in the origin and destination vectors can equal 1, while the rest of them are 0. In other words, the sum of elements of the origin and destination vectors must equal 1. We will work this into a constraint in a later unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantastic, you now know how to extract information from the travel cost matrix $C$ and express the travel cost for a single trip. However, it is necessary to express these ideas in a mathematical format for the solver. In the previous example the trip was hard-coded to go from location $0$ to location $1$. Let's generalize for any trip:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_v \\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } v \\in \\{0,2N-1\\}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Travel cost for single trip }=  \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 & x_1 & \\dots & x_{N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \\dots & c_{0,N-1} \\\\ c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \\dots & c_{1,N-1} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1,0} & c_{N-1,1} & \\dots & c_{N-1,N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{N} \\\\ x_{N+1}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{2N-1} \\end{bmatrix}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $x_v$ represents a location before or after a trip. The reason that the destination vector elements are indexed from $N+1$ to $2N$ instead of $0$ to $N-1$ is to differentiate the origin variables and destination variables for the solver. If this is not done, the solver would consider the origin and destination the same, meaning that the spaceship would never take off to its destination planet! When submitting the optimization problem, the solver will determine which $x_v$ is assigned a value 1 or 0, dependent on the respective trip's travel cost. To re-iterate an important point, the sum of the origin and destination vector elements must be 1 as the spaceship can not be in more than or less than one location at a time: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Sum of the origin vector elements: }\\sum_{v = 0}^{N-1} x_v = 1, $$ \n",
    "$$ \\text{Sum of the destination vector elements: }\\sum_{v = N}^{2N-1} x_v = 1.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the basic mathematical formulations are covered, the scope can be expanded. As the spaceship's navigation engineer, it is your job to calculate a route between multiple planets, moons, and asteroids, to help make the space rock mining endeavour more succesful. With the travel cost matrix and the origin/destination vectors defined, you are equipped with the right mathematical tools to start looking at routes through the solar system. Let's take a look at how two trips can be modeled!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the travel costs for a route\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the travel costs for two trips, which can be considered a route, you will need a way to describe the **total** travel cost. As you might expect, the total cost of a route is simply the sum of the trip's travel costs that constitute the route (sum of the trips). Say you have a route $R$ in which the spacehip travels from location $1$ to location $3$ to location $2$. Then the total cost is the sum of the trips' costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Cost of route: } R_{1-3-2} = c_{1,3}+c_{3,2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking a closer look at the equation a very important relation is found. The destination for the first trip and the origin for the second trip are the same. Incorporating this relation in the cost function will help reduce the number of variables the solver has to optimize for. As a result of the simplification, the optimization problem becomes much easier and has an increased probability of finding suitable solutions! \n",
    "\n",
    "> [!TECHNICAL NOTE]\n",
    "> For the 2-trip example this recurrence relation reduces the solver search space size (number of possible routes/solutions) from $2^N \\cdot 2^N \\cdot 2^N \\cdot 2^N$ to $2^N \\cdot 2^N \\cdot 2^N$, a factor $N$ ($N$ = 10 in this module) difference. Without considering constraints, each vector element can take two values (${0,1}$) and has a length $N$, therefore each vector multiplies the solution set by $2^N$. The reduction in variables becomes even more apparent for longer routes. Visiting the 10 planets, moons, and asteroids as in this module, the relation reduces the search space size from $2^{20N}$ to $2^{11N}$! The number of variables optimized for decreases from $200$ to $110$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the travel costs can be written with vectors and matrices. Then the total travel cost of the route is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Cost of route } = \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 & x_1 & \\dots & x_{N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \\dots & c_{0,N-1} \\\\ c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \\dots & c_{1,N-1} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1,0} & c_{N-1,1} & \\dots & c_{N-1,N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{N} \\\\ x_{N+1}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{2N-1} \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} x_{N} & x_{N+1} & \\dots & x_{2N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} c_{0,0} & c_{0,1} & \\dots & c_{0,N-1} \\\\ c_{1,0} & c_{1,1} & \\dots & c_{1,N-1} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ c_{N-1,0} & c_{N-1,1} & \\dots & c_{N-1,N-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{2N} \\\\ x_{2N+1}\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{3N-1} \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation the destination vector of the first trip and the origin vector of the second trip contain the same variables, making use of the recurrence relation. Generalizing the 2-trip route to a $N$-trip route is achieved by including more vector-matrix multiplications in the addition. Written out as a sum:\n",

    "### Coding the travel costs \n",
    "\n",
    "For the solvers to find a suitable solution, you will need to specify how it should calculate the travel cost for a route. The solver requires you to define a cost term for each possible trip-origin-destination combination given by the variables $k$, $i$, $j$, respectively. As described by the cost function above, the weighting is simply the $c_{i,j}$-th element of the cost matrix, resembling the distance between the locations. For example, weighting a trip from location $1$ to location $2$ in the second trip ($k=1$) has the following weighting:\n",
    "\n",

    "Below, you can find the code snippet that will be added to the Python script. We define a problem instance through the `OptProblem` function, in which we will continue to append pieces of code throughout the module's units. Later, this problem will be submitted to the Azure solvers. If you want to see how the weights are assigned to each $ x_{Nk+i} \\cdot x_{N(k+1)+j}$ combination, you can uncomment the last lines in the code.

Fortunately, relative to the other constraints, these are very easy to include! The only elements you will need to add to the navigation system's code are an initial location weighting, and a final location weighting.

Returning to home base after $N$ trips is given by x_{N^2}=1. Assigning these specific variables negative weights in the cost function will promote the solver to give them that value. \n",

For example, visiting Venus after the $5$-th trip can be accomplished by negatively weighting $x_{3+5N}$. Alternatively, the weighting procedure can be used to promote a particular set of locations after a trip! For example, if you want to include a constraint about where the spaceship can and can't mine or sell after a trip, then you can negatively weight those set of locations. \n",

Also, the cost function is automatically simplified for you when calling the method as the variables are filled in. The reason why the method is not implemented in this module is because you would not be able to encourage the spaceship to choose between a set of locations for a trip, a consequence of hard-coding the variable values.

    "There are numerous solvers (algorithms) and targets (hardware providers) available in the Azure Quantum optimization service. Choosing a which to use is not straightforward, it is recommended to review the [Microsoft QIO provider](/azure/quantum/provider-microsoft-qio?azure-portal=true) and [1QBit provider](/azure/quantum/provider-1qbit?azure-portal=true) documentation pages for further information and references. We will briefly cover some background of the solvers which might help you decide how you would like to submit the optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no standardized way of finding the best solver for (highly) non-convex problems. For these optimization problems you are left with two options. First, you can use `heuristic solvers`. Heuristic methods can be understood as searches of the optimization landscape in which as many minima want to be found as possible. The second option is to use linearizations of the problem, suitable for small and 'easy' non-convex problems (`constraint relaxation`, `cost function linearization`, etc.). For linearizations, a degree of accuracy is paid to reduce the problem complexity. However, for large non-convex problems linearizations usually perform poorly are as they generate **local** and **approximate** solutions. (Approximating nonlinearies with linear functions becomes increasingly difficult with the degree of nonlinearities). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the traveling salesperson problem, it is practically required to use heuristic solvers due to the combinatioral explosion with the number of locations. The main bottleneck is how to efficiently design/weight the cost function and how to choose the right solver. Choosing an appropriate solver requires some research as each heuristic method is tailored for specific problem conditions. It can therefore be that a solver performs poorly on a certain problem instance, but well on another. Usually, finding a suitable one requires experimentation, and/or more thorough insight into the problem. To help you with that, you can consider the following notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the problem properties? \n",
    "  - Is the problem convex or non-convex (rugged)? Is the optimization landscape slightly rugged(hills), or very rugged (peaks)?\n",
    "  - How large is the optimization problem (given by the number of variables $x_v$)?  \n",
    "  - Are you looking at an Ising model ($x_v \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ ), or a PUBO/QUBO model ($x_v \\in \\{0,1\\}$)?\n",
    "  - Can you reduce or simplify the optimization problem? Smaller cost functions will reduce computational effort for the solvers, and save time!\n",
    "2. Finding solvers through experimentation. \n",
    "  - Try a solver that you can use as a reference to compare to other solver performances, such as accuracy or time. For example, simulated annealing generally does well on a wide range of problems and can provide an initial metric to evaluate other solvers.\n",
    "  - Also, in early stages it can be helpful to use a solver for which parameters do not need to be tuned (`parameter-free`).\n",
    "  - Select solvers which match well with the problem, for an overview see the documentation [solvers and targets](/azure/quantum/qio-target-list?azure-portal=true).  \n",
    "  - Try other solvers and compare their performances. \n",
    "  - Do all solvers perform poorly? Consider redesigning the cost function or a longer solver time (`timeout`). Often you can make the cost function more efficient for the solver, some tips are described in the [documentation](/azure/quantum/provider-microsoft-qio?azure-portal=true).\n",
    "  - Are there some good results? Consider these solvers as candidates for the fine-tuning process. Fine-tuning can be a lot of work, therefore it is useful to have a small subset of solvers. \n",
    "  - Solver selection is an iterative process. If possible, it can be helpful to experiment on small-scale problem as this might be more insightful and reduce effort. \n",
    "3. Fine-tuning candidate solvers.\n",
    "  - Improve the performances by defining solver parameters such as, start conditions, convergence criteria, sweeps, etc. \n",
    "  - Depending on the scale of the problem and solver type, you can consider different hardware (CPUs / FPGAs / GPUs / Annealers) and targets. \n",
    "  - Adjust the cost function weights specifically for a type of solver.\n",
    "  - Solver tuning is also an iterative process.\n",

    "The travel costs of the spaceship can change when the space rocks need to be mined or sold on different planets. For the cost function it is important to take this into account, as you want the travel costs and constraints to have a constant relative weighting. Otherwise it could be the case that the solver punishes a constraint much less strictly, resulting in poor routes. Weighting the constraints as a function of the cost matrix as well, like the travel costs, will allow you to have constant relative weighting in the cost function. Then regardless of the distances between planets, moons, and asteroids considered, the navigation system should generate efficient routes. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Some tips for the tuning process:\n",
    "  - Start by assigning the start and end locations $w_4$ and $w_5$ with a big negative weight (but keep $\\alpha \\leq$  10). Once this constraint is always satisfied, work on the other constraint weights.\n",
    "  - Look at the printed route, and see which constraint it violates. Then try to tune the respective constraint(s) accordingly. Iteratively try to do this and you will eventually find good routes!\n",

    "## Submitting the code\n",
    "\n",

    "  - A) 'Some of the \"one location at a time\" constraint terms can be merged with some of the \"no revisiting locations\" constraint terms.'\n",
    "  - B) 'The \"start and end locations\" constraint terms can be merged with some of the \"no dissapearing constraint\" terms.'\n",

    "4. 'Which of the following statements is FALSE?'\n",
    "  - A) 'Each solver has its advantages and disadvantages, and their applicability depends on the considered optimization problem.'\n",
    "  - B) 'The tuning process is only about finding suitable cost function weights.'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  \n",
    "  - A) 'Incorrect. Even though you could form it into a constraint, using the relation to reduce the number of different vectors simplifies the problem significantly.'\n",
    "  - B) 'Incorrect. It is still necessary to represent each location before/after each trip. But the total number of vectors, or total number of variables, is greatly reduced.'\n",
    "  - C) 'Correct! By reducing the number of vectors in the optimization problem it becomes much easier to solve. The number of variables the solver needs to optimize for is much smaller.'  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "  - A) 'Correct! Negatively weighting constraint, or terms, locally decreases the cost function value(s). This increases the chance that the solver settles for a preferenced solution.'\n",
    "  - B) 'Incorrect. Because of the non-convexities, and how the solvers work underwater (random walks), it can not be guaranteed that a particlar solution is returned. This is why you have to verify the results!'\n",
    "  - C) 'Incorrect. This may be the case, but it is not a strict condition. For example, the maximum value of the cost function could decrease which probably will not immediataly make it a local minima.'\n",
    "\n",
    "3.   \n",
    "  - A) 'Incorrect. There is no overlap between the terms in these two constraint. The first weights products of variables over the trips while the second weights products of variables for a location vector.'\n",
    "  - B) 'Correct! Both constraints weight individual terms. The terms for the first location and last location can be combined with a new weighting equal to the sum of the weights.'\n",
    "  - C) 'Incorrect. There is no overlap between the terms in these two constraints. The first weights individual variables, the second products of individual variables.'\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  \n",
    "  - A) 'This statement is correct. Solvers have properties that may or may not (or less) suitable for a particular optimization problem.'\n",
    "  - B) 'This statement is incorrect. Tuning is also about finding appropriate solvers, solver parameters, and hardware.'\n",
    "  - C) 'This statement is correct. The NP-hardness is caused by the combinatorial explosion and because verification of optimality is non-polynomial time.'"
