Well done! You have completed the development of the spaceship's navigation system. 

In this module, you learned:
- What the traveling salesperson problem is, its applications, and its relevance in non-convex optimization.
- How to model the travel costs, with real interplanetary mean-distances, to construct a cost function.
- How to model problem constraints and incorporate these into the cost function.
- Some brief theory on solvers and how to verify the results.
- How to tune the constraint weights.

## Next steps

To learn or challenge yourself more, you can look at increasing the difficulty of the problem:
- Increase the number of planets, moons, and asteroids that need to be visited.
- Try different solvers, and how to tune the solver parameters.
- Incorporate more constraints on where the spaceship can be after some trip. 
- Change the problem costs to include orbital mechanics, meaning the distances change over time (difficult). 
- Try solving a small traveling salesperson problem with Q#, see the [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/) on how you could approach doing this.

Alternatively, you may also consider variations of the traveling salesperson problem:
- Vehicle routing problem (multiple spaceships)
- Consider how many space rocks the spaceship can carry (constraint on when to mine or sell).
- Consider having constraints on the spaceship's energy consumption.
