## Intro 
This is a module in which you can learn how to solve the traveling salesperson problem (TSP) with the Azure Quantum service. More broadly, it covers cost function formulation for a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization).
The TSP problem, or a generalzied/more specific version of it, is relevant in many areas: control systems, bioinformatics, circuitry, networking, etc.

In the module, you will construct and solve the TSP step-by-step to build a navigation system for a spaceship that has to travel through the solar system.
Concepts are gradually built on top of each other such that it is easy to follow. For reading, it is recommended to use the HTML file. For playing around with the code the Python notebook (ipynb) or Python are both suitable.
- The only requirement for the module is vector-matrix products, the rest should be clear from context.

### Disclaimer 
There are classical algorithms, such as v-opt, that will outperform the heuristic solvers provided by Azure Quantum for the TSP. 
This TSP module is still a great introduction to both nonlinear optimization as well as Azure Quantum.

I wrote this MS Learn module during my internship at Microsoft. It was decided to not publish it however, by providing some of the files here, I hope it can help some people learn more about nonlinear optimization!
