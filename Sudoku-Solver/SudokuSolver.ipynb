    "# Solving sudokus with Azure Quantum solvers\n",

    "Hello and welcome! In this Jupyter notebook we will explain how you can solve Sudoku puzzles with quantum-inspired optimization. This automation step will allow you check your sudoku solutions, or even better, you will never have to do soduku manually again! For humans these puzzles can be very challenging and time-consuming, even though the rules of the game are quite simple. A perfect case to demonstrate the use and learn more about optimization!\n",

The Azure quantum inspired solvers, or even the specific underlying hardware, **might not be the most suitable for solving** Sudoku problems. Nevertheless, these small scale problems are good learning material for more challenging optimization problems you may face elsewhere!"

    "\n",
    "- Sudoku is an NP-complete problem. This means that finding a solution is difficult (non-polynomial time), but verifying the solution can be done easily (polynomial time).\n",
    "- Because of the NP-completeness, it is hard to say what kind of solver works 'best'. However, as always, certain algorithms are (or can be) more suitable for a problem. \n",
    "    - For a small Sudokus, like $9\\times9$, backtracking techniques are useful (like Algorithm X with \"Dancing Links\"). Backtracking algorithms test out all (partial) solutions to find the one that satisfies the constraints. \n",
    "    - For large Sudokus, like $25\\times25$, backtracking techniques become computationally expensive. Other methods, such as constraint relaxation to employ linear programming (could also use branch-and-bound) or stochastic optimization can then also be considered. These methods have their own specific advantages and disadvantages. The most important to keep in mind is that by employing these methods you are trading in accuracy to reduce computational effort/complexity (average trade-off over many problem instances, does not have to be the case for problem X). In fact, these methods are not even guaranteed to converge due to the inherent approximations, local minima, non-determinism, etc. \n",
    "    - Sudoku puzzles can be considered a graph-coloring problem, each integer-value would be associated with a color. The graph-coloring problem is very famous and difficult, read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring. If you're interested in solving the graph coloring problem with Q#, check out this module: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/solve-graph-coloring-problems-grovers-search/.   \n",

    "### Problem background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku puzzles usually take place on a $9\\times9$ grid, but can be any $n^2 \\times n^2$ grid, in which many numbers are missing. The goal is to fill in numbers $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...,n^2\\}$ such that the following constraints are satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constraint 1: A number may appear only once per row. \n",
    "- Constraint 2: A number may appear only once per column.\n",
    "- Constraint 3: A number may appear only once per $n\\times n$ subgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! Finding the solution however, which you may assume is unique, is not straightforward. Solving these puzzles, which belong to a class called \"constraint satisfaction problems\",  is a lengthy iterative procedure. Fortunately, computers can speed things up a bit! Numerous algorithmic approaches exist, such as backtracking, mixed integer linear programming, simplex method with constraint relaxations, stochastic optimization, or brute force searches. The links in the 'interesting notes' section will refer you to further reading!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will consider converting the mixed integer linear programming problem (\"MILP\"/\"ILP\") to a binary integer linear programming problem, which will then be cast as a polynomial unconstrained optimization problem (\"PUBO\"). The difference between these is how the optimization problems are expressed. In MILP, the optimization variables can take any integer value in the set $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...,n^2\\}$. In the binary case, the optimization variables can only take values of 0 and 1, $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Lastly, for the Azure quantum-inspired solvers to understand the problem, it is necessary to convert the problem to a PUBO (or Ising for other problems) model. \n",

    "## Converting to a binary optimization problem - variables\n",

    "For the Azure solvers it is necessary to recast the sudoku optimization problem to a binary form. There are two available formats, the Ising model $x_i \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ and the PUBO/QUBO model $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Here we will consider the the second, which is the easiest way to rewrite the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going from $x_i \\in \\{1,2,...n^2\\}$ to $x_i \\in {0,1}$ requires a different formulation for the problem. Consider a single cell in which we want to assign a particular value. Now it is not possible to simply assign a number in the set. However what we can do is abstract a little bit. Representing each value in the set $\\{1,2,...n^2\\}$ by a binary variable $x_v$ is neat trick to convert to a binary problem. For example:\n",

    "Now if a value 2 needs to be filled into a cell, we can describe that by assigning $x_2=1$, and keeping all other variables equal to zero. Why do other variables need to be zero? The reason is that we are **selecting per cell**, and only one value may be filled in a cell. Therefore there are $n^2$ $x$ variables per cell in order to describe which integer needs to be filled in. \n",

For simplicity, we can assume an indexing of $x_{\\Large{r,c,v}}$, with $r$ denoting the row number, $c$ the column number, and $v$ representing the value in the set integer set. For example, if we want to assign cell (8,8) a value in the shown picture above, which is the most bottom right cell (cell count starts at 0), then we'd have to choose from the set of variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the reformulation, there are $n^2$ variables per cell. Only one of these variables may be assigned a value 1 by the solver, as the rules of Sudoku prohibit filling in multiple integers per cell. For this, another constraint has to be added to the problem to avoid multiple variables per cell becoming nonzero. It is necessary to penalize relationships between variables that reside in the same cells. One easy way to accomplish this is to penalize the products of variables. Considering a single cell, you could model the constraint as: \n",

Investigating the constraint more thoroughly, you may realize that the constituent parts must also be zero. The constraint of the $n^2$ variables can be split. Only one variable may be assigned a value 1 by the solver, essentially meaning that we have to check each dual combination between variables. If all are zero, then you can be sure that **no more** than one variable has value 1. Mathematically the idea is expressed as:\n",

Consider a general $9 \\times 9$ sudoku, $x_3$ and $x_{12}$ both represent the integer '4' (first row, first and second cell), the solver may not set both equal to 1.
