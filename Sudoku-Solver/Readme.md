## Intro -- Sudoku Solver
This is a module in which you can learn how to solve Sudokus with the Azure Quantum service. More broadly, it covers cost function formulation for a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization).


### Disclaimer 
There are classical algorithms, which can outperform the heuristic solvers (mostly for small Sudokus). Nevertheless, Sudokus are a fun example to consider for learning optimization!

## About
Author: Max Lucassen  
I wrote this sample during my internship at Microsoft. I hope it can help some people learn more about (nonlinear) optimization!
